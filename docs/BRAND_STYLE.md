# Godwit brand style reference

This file records the palette and typography currently used by the Godwit
application, QR portal, and printable business cards. Hex values are the
source-of-truth values from `src/style.css` and the brand assets.

## Typography

| Role | Font stack | Weight and treatment | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Interface and body | `"Trebuchet MS", "Segoe UI", sans-serif` | 400 by default; 600-800 for labels, buttons, and navigation | Application screens, forms, explanatory copy, business-card body text |
| Editorial display | `Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif` | 700 where emphasis is needed | Wordmark, QR portal headings, large editorial headings |
| QR export fallback | `Arial, sans-serif` | Regular or bold as specified by the export | Canvas-generated QR artwork where predictable browser rendering is useful |

The application does not bundle font files. The first available font in each
stack is used, with the following fonts as platform fallbacks.

## Core palette

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--ink` | `#172B2B` | Deep ink | Main light-theme text |

| `--line` | `#D6E2DE` | Pale sage border | Dividers and light-theme borders |
| `--teal` / `--action-primary` | `#0F766E` | Godwit teal | Primary actions, links, accents, and focus states |

Use white text on teal, navy, or deep-gold controls. Use `--navy-deep` or
`--ink` text on the gold accent.

## Logo and print palette

The Godwit mark uses a gold diagonal gradient:

| Gradient stop | Hex |
| --- | --- |
| 0% | `#C08A26` |
| 50% | `#E8BC55` |
| 100% | `#F7DA8A` |

The business cards add these print-oriented supporting colors:

| Color | Hex | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Warm paper | `#FFFDF8` | Card background |
| Paper highlight | `#F8F5ED` | Card gradient start |
| Sage | `#E5F0E9` | Card gradient midpoint |
| Sage-teal | `#D9EBE5` | Card gradient end |
| Deep green | `#123B36` | Wordmark and primary card text |
| Card teal text | `#315C55` | Benefits and supporting copy |
| Tagline green | `#416B64` | Small tagline text |

The printed cards use a subtle teal border (`rgba(15, 118, 110, 0.28)`) and a
subtle gold glow (`rgba(203, 151, 30, 0.18)`) rather than additional solid
brand colors.

## Light and dark themes

### Light theme

The light experience is warm and editorial:

- Page background: `#F7F5EF`
- Main panel: translucent `#FFFDF8`
- Input surface: `#FFFEFB`
- Input border: `#CBD5C4`
- Secondary panel: `#F0F1E9`
- Supporting text: `#5F6C65`
- Teal and gold remain the primary accents.

The recommended visual direction is **sunlit meadow**: warm paper, sage
surfaces, and a small amount of gold light. It should feel optimistic and
creative without turning the interface into a bright yellow theme.

### Dark theme

The dark experience uses the navy family while retaining teal and gold accents:

| Role | Hex |
| --- | --- |
| Text | `#E7ECF5` |
| Muted text | `#A9B6CB` |
| Canvas | `#081326` |
| Surface | `#101F38` |
| Border | `#2C4165` |
| Input surface | `#10223E` |
| Input border | `#385277` |
| Placeholder | `#8FA0BB` |

The recommended visual direction is **evening marsh**: deep blue-green space,
quiet blue highlights, and gold used like a small point of reflected light.
This keeps long admin sessions calm while preserving the Godwit identity.

### Flock background

The flock section is intentionally a shared stage for the characters rather
than another white card grid:

| Theme | Background | Soft glow |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Light | `#214B46` | `#2D635D` |
| Dark | `#071A2D` | `#102D46` |

The flock uses restrained radial glows: gold and sky blue in light mode, sky
blue and lavender in dark mode. This gives the flock depth while keeping
the bird marks and text readable.

### Character color associations

Each character has a memorable accent color for its avatar badge and related
feature moments. These are supporting colors, not replacements for the
primary teal/gold action system.

| Character | Association | Color | Deep companion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Robin | Welcome, warmth, first steps | `#E76F51` | `#B94F3A` |
| Tern | Speed, clarity, lightweight polls | `#4EA5D9` | `#2F719E` |
| Flamingo | Connection, delight, social confidence | `#E9789A` | `#B94D70` |
| Magpie | Curiosity, collecting, creative variety | `#8B78D6` | `#5C4CA4` |
| Redshank | Care, early warning, protective action | `#D95D39` | `#9E3E27` |
| Owl | Trust, oversight, thoughtful control | `#A78BFA` | `#6D55B8` |
| Waxwing | Insight, premium polish, momentum | `#E9B44C` | `#B7771E` |

## Usage rules

1. Prefer the CSS custom properties in `src/style.css` instead of introducing
   new one-off colors.
2. Keep teal for primary interaction and gold for secondary emphasis; do not
   use gold as the only signal for success or focus.
3. Preserve readable contrast between text and tinted surfaces, especially in
   QR portal and mobile layouts.
4. Keep the logo gradient limited to the Godwit mark; use the solid gold token
   for interface controls and navigation states.
