// Robin's persona guide: three common ways people use Godwit, each with a short, ordered set
// of recommended next steps built entirely from features that already exist in the product.
// Shown on the Admin Overview tab once a workspace picks "what are you using Godwit for?".
//
// Each step points at either an Admin tab (`tab`) or a direct route (`route`) to jump to. A
// step can optionally declare a `feature` key (matching entitlements.js/FEATURE_COPY) if it
// needs a paid plan - Robin's guide then shows an inline "Available on X · Upgrade" note
// before the admin clicks through, instead of only relying on the destination tab's own
// LockedFeature prompt to break the news.
