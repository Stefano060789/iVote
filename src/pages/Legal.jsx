        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Who is responsible for this data</h2>
        <p>
          Godwit is operated by {OPERATOR_NAME} ("Godwit", "we"). For your own account and workspace settings, we are
          the data controller under the GDPR. For personal data that voters choose to share through your polls
          (an opted-in email, a private message, a prize-draw entry), your workspace is the controller and Godwit
          acts only as a data processor on your instructions - see "Data controller vs. processor" in our Terms of
          Service for what that means for you.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Data we process</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
          <li><strong>Account &amp; workspace data:</strong> your login email, workspace/company name, logo, brand colors, and team member roles and invitations.</li>
          <li><strong>Poll and vote data:</strong> the questions and answers a workspace configures, and the answers voters submit. Voting itself never requires an account and is not linked to an identity unless a voter chooses to leave contact details.</li>
          <li><strong>Optional voter-provided data, only with explicit consent:</strong> an email address left for follow-up, a prize-draw entry, or return-visit recognition; a free-text message to the organizer with an optional reply email.</li>
          <li><strong>QR placement/staff labels:</strong> labels a workspace admin assigns to a QR code or a staff member, visible only inside that workspace.</li>
          <li><strong>Billing data:</strong> handled directly by Stripe. Godwit stores only your plan and subscription status, never full card details.</li>
          <li><strong>Technical/error data:</strong> if the workspace operator has enabled it, basic crash reports (Sentry) that may include a stack trace. IP address collection is switched off by default in our error monitoring configuration.</li>
          <li><strong>Local device storage:</strong> a flag on the voter's own device recording that a given poll was already answered, and a couple of small UI preference flags. Not used for cross-site tracking and not shared with third parties.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Why we process it (legal basis)</h2>
        <p>
          Providing your workspace account and the poll/QR features you configure is necessary to perform our contract
          with you. Capturing a voter's email, prize-draw entry, or private message always requires their explicit,
          separate consent, given through a checkbox at the point of collection - it is never bundled with voting
          itself. Security, fraud prevention, and keeping the service running rely on our legitimate interest in
          operating Godwit safely.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">How long we keep it</h2>
        <p>
          Votes are kept until a workspace configures a shorter automatic retention window (7 to 3,650 days) in
          Settings; a daily background job then permanently deletes votes older than that window. Opted-in voter
          emails and workspace data are kept until the workspace, or the voter directly, asks for deletion.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Who we share data with</h2>
        <p>We use the following processors to run Godwit. We do not sell personal data, and we do not use data collected through your polls for our own marketing.</p>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
          <li><strong>Supabase</strong> - database, authentication, and file storage</li>
          <li><strong>Vercel</strong> - application hosting and scheduled jobs</li>
          <li><strong>Stripe</strong> - payment processing for paid plans</li>
          <li><strong>Resend</strong> - delivery of transactional and opted-in follow-up emails</li>
          <li><strong>Sentry</strong> - error monitoring, only if the operator enables it</li>
          <li><strong>OpenAI</strong> - optional AI features (QR poster images, sentiment tagging), only if the operator enables them</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">Some of these providers may process data outside your country; each maintains its own safeguards for international transfers, such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Your rights</h2>
        <p>
          Subject to applicable law (including the GDPR), you can ask to access, correct, export, or delete your
          personal data, restrict or object to its processing, and withdraw consent at any time. Account holders can
          submit these requests directly from the <Link className="text-blue-300 underline" to="/account">Account</Link> page.
          Voters can withdraw email consent using the unsubscribe link in any email, or by contacting us. Every
          automated marketing email we send includes a working unsubscribe link.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">If you are a customer of one of our workspaces (for example, you voted at a venue) and want your data
          deleted, you can contact that venue directly, or reach us at <ContactEmail />
          {" "}and we will assist.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Children</h2>
        <p>Godwit is not directed at children and we do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone below the applicable local minimum age of digital consent (14 in Austria; 16 in most other EU countries unless locally lowered).</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Security</h2>
        <p>Each workspace's data is isolated at the database level, API keys are stored only as one-way hashes, and connections are encrypted in transit. No method of storage or transmission is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Changes to this notice</h2>
        <p>We will update the date below when this notice changes and, for material changes, tell workspace owners directly.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Using Godwit</h2>
        <p>By creating a workspace or using a poll link, you agree to these terms. Workspace owners are responsible for their polls, notices, and the lawful use of the responses they collect.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Acceptable use</h2>
        <p>Poll questions, answers, and custom voter answers may not contain political, religious, or sexual content; Godwit screens for this automatically and any voter can report content they believe is inappropriate for manual review.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Data controller vs. processor</h2>
        <p>
          Your workspace is the <strong>data controller</strong> for the personal data your own customers (voters)
          choose to share through your polls - opted-in emails, prize-draw entries, private messages. Godwit is only
          a <strong>data processor</strong>: we store and process that data on your instructions and do not use it
          for our own purposes. You are responsible for having a lawful basis to collect it (the explicit consent
          checkboxes already built into voting exist for this reason) and for responding to your own customers'
          rights requests regarding that data, using the tools provided or by contacting us for help.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Prize draws and rewards</h2>
        <p>
          If you enable a prize draw, Godwit automatically shows entrants the official rules (no purchase necessary,
          18+ and locally eligible only, one entry per person, random winner, void where prohibited). You are the
          sponsor of any prize draw or reward you configure and are responsible for complying with the sweepstakes,
          gambling, and consumer-protection laws that apply to you, including any registration or bonding
          requirement for higher-value prizes in your jurisdiction.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Reviews</h2>
        <p>
          Godwit's public review links are shown to every voter regardless of their answer, and no reward may be
          tied to leaving a review, in line with major review platforms' policies. Do not use the reward, message,
          or redemption fields to recreate a gated or incentivized review flow outside the product.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Billing</h2>
        <p>Paid plans renew monthly through Stripe until cancelled. Current prices and plan limits are shown in Billing and may change with notice.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Suspension and termination</h2>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate a workspace that violates these terms, including the acceptable-use and prize-draw/review rules above, or that has a seriously overdue balance.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>Godwit is provided "as is" during this pilot phase, without warranties of any kind, to the maximum extent permitted by law. Nothing here limits liability that cannot be limited under mandatory law, including statutory consumer rights.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Governing law</h2>
        <p>These terms are governed by Austrian law, and the competent courts at our registered seat have jurisdiction, without prejudice to any mandatory consumer-protection rights you have in your own country of residence.</p>
